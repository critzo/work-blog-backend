When OTI heard that one of the [MozFest 2017](https://mozillafestival.org/) "Spaces" was going to be focused on decentralization, we decided to see if we could really emphasize the local and community aspects of decentralized tech, while also providing a demonstration of a truly useful service to all of the MozFest attendees. With that in mind, we proposed--and Mozilla Foundation has accepted--a portable, battery powered, resilient, and artsy chat service for all at MozFest to use. Our plan will combine [system-on-a-chip computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip), hardware hacking, visualization coding, and probably a spreadsheet or two.

Here's what it looks like we're going to need:

* The [Matrix.org](https://matrix.org) federated chat system, and the kind folks from Matrix have agreed to provide advice when we inevitably break something. 
* A case of some sort that is tough and portable--some 3D printing may come into play here.
* A small computer on a chip--A [Raspberry Pi 3](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/) is an obvious candidate but we also have a ton of ODroids lying about the office.
* Some sort of display that we can try to mount either on the case itself or somewhere else.
* An external decently-sized USB hard drive to store a weekend's worth of communications.

Oh, and MozFest starts October 27th.

If you want to follow along while we pull this together, keep an eye on this space.
